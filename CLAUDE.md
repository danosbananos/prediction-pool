# Prediction Pool — Project Instructions

## Git workflow
- New features / feature bundles go on a `feature/<name>` branch.
- Bugfixes go on a `bugfix/<name>` branch.
- Always ask before committing and before pushing.
- After pushing, automatically continue with: create PR and merge to main. Don't ask for confirmation on PR/merge steps.
